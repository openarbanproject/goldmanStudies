# goldmanStudies
Recreation of Edwin Franko Goldman's Practical Studies for Cornet (and Trumpet)

These are being written out for use in teaching.
Obviously the images quality is better than the public domain (1921) version that you can find online.

Documents for each study in their original keys include the original instructions so that maybe
in future we could put a complete book out. 

Extra keys are added for convenience and as a teaching aid.
The keys of these extra files are chosen as I think I would use them but for now I'm not bothering to
do every exercise in every key because these could be created from the original document in less than a 
minute as you need them. 

Fee free to create the files if you want, but if you do then put all of the alternate key files 
into a folder to keep things tidy.
